NVMExplorer is a cross-stack design space exploration framework to compare and evaluate future on-chip memory solutions with system constraints and application-level impacts in-the-loop. Using NVMExplorer, a user can evaluate eNVM-based storage for a range of application and system contexts, e.g., machine learning on the edge, graph analytics, and general purpose cache. Additionally, NVMExplorer provides an interactive and easily navigable set of data visualizations, which allow users to quickly answer their specific questions regarding eNVMs, filter according to system and application constraints, and efficiently iterate and refine the design space.
